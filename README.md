# Project Overview
Modern medical imaging has proven time and again to be a field which could see immense benefit from the utilization of computer vision networks in aiding professionals of the medical field. COVID-19 continues to affect individuals with compromised immune systems and can often lead to secondary infections. For this project, we look into the image classification abilities of several model architectures: ResNetV2, EfficientNetV2, and ConvNeXt.

The goal of this project is to test how well these architectures are able to perform in a classification task, as well as conclude whether or not they might be suitable for a real world implementation in a professional medical setting.
